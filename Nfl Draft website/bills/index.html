    <h3>WHO WE SHOULD DRAFT</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Round 2 - Trvon Diggs - CB Bama </li>
        <li class="detail">He's a 6'2 corner that's long as a bitch. Homie has a way with finding the football and isn't scared to make a tackle. He's a edge guy which will keep taron johnson at the slot corner spot.  We need corner depth to help Tray Day.</li>
        <li>Round 3 - Zack Moss - HB Utah </li>
        <li class="detail">A tough nose runner with some flare. He's a great 1-2 punch with Devin.  He has alot of the quickness but is more down hill and will get you 2 yards on 3rd and two.  But he's still a weapon in the pass game.</li>
        <li>Round 4 - Derrek Tuszka - DE/OLB NDSU. </li>
        <li class="detail">Big strong and fast.  If he falls this late as projected it'll be a steal.  I think he can play a bit of OLB if needed as well.  He has potential but I don't think he's a day one starter by any means part of a rotation at most.</li>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 30px;">Round 5 - Some O Lineman I'm not scouting O Lineman</li>
        <li>Round 6 - James Proche - WR, SMU. </li>
        <li class="detail">I really really like this guy.  He reminds me so much of antonio brown.  This WR class is so stacked he shouldn't be a day three guy. He's a playmaker which I think is what the bills need.  A guy who can take a drag route and make a play.  I think he can return as well he had a ability to make the 1st guy miss</li>

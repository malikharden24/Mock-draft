                        <p>Talk about dynamic, his film speaks for itself. Proche jumps off the board.  It's obvious he was the best on the field every time he stepped onto it. Resembling a young and zoomy Antonio Brown this guy just makes plays.  With a small from at 5'11 he still goes up strong and makes the toughest of grabs.  Move him to a bigger school he's a top 8 WR in this class. WATCH HIS TAPE, one handed grabs making people miss.  He's a gem in disguise and in a less deep WR class he could be a day one draft pick.

                        <p>He's the north dakota version of a joey bosa. Great mix of size and power, you can see him BULLY lineman on film.  With a motor that's relentless he's going to make a difference somewhere.  It's evident he was the best lineman on the field.  He will need to grow his move set; he tends to rely on his swim all the time.  But fuck the shit works. He's a patriot type of guy that gets drafted and becomes a stud, with the long flowy hair to match.

                        <p>The great value version of the Josh Allen.  Sometimes hes a stud sometimes he's a dud. This one could go either way.  If he goes somewhere and he has to start first year its OVER.  He won't make it in the league and i believe a lot of teams think he's NFL ready.  If he's able to sit for a year or two his success rate will double if not even triple. And the dude doesn't have the football edge the guys guy type of grit.  He's tyrod taylor esk in the leadership department.

                        <p>This guy is a solid player, I just don't think he'd a first overall talent as he's slated. He has a great burst and effort, decent cover guy man or zone.  He has solid instincts as well.  The guy makes playes BUT they're awful throws by the QB.  Almost all of his plays were bad throws and that gives me worry.  I think he's going to be a good 2 option at corner but I don't think he'll live up to his draft value.  He has the physicals I just don't see the big play potential.
